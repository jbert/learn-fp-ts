- write 'reader task either from scratch' md in docs
    DONE - heterogeneous list (nums or error string)
        - handling requires policy at the point of processing
            - print all errors or num errors
    - typed array of data (typed with either<num,string>)
        - creation of handling functions which don't define policy
            (obv can be done in other ways)
    - typed array of actions (TE)
        - embraces async nature of node (???)
    - typed array of configurable actions (RTE)
        - pass selection parameter
    - typed array of with injected sub-actions (RTE)
        - or go direct to effects?
